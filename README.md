# Prototype Description

The MAX-Calculator is a Python-built program designed to facilitate users in performing various mathematical functions and operations, exceeding the capabilities of basic calculators. Core operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, modulus and finding the root of a number. The program features built-in prompts to enhance user interaction and ease of use.

The MAX-Calculator is a Python-built program designed to facilitate users in performing various mathematical functions and operations, exceeding the capabilities of basic calculators. Core operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, finding the root of a number, and the modulus of the number. The program features built-in prompts to enhance user interaction and ease of use.

To provide a seamless user experience, here are the prompts that will guide the user:

    Welcome to the MAX-Calculator
    What is your Name? (The Username will be saved and recorded into a txt file named User_Name)
    What operation would you like to perform?
    Basic Operation
    Expression
    Unit Conversion
    Variable Expression
    Command History
    History Management
    Help Documentation
    Quit
Based on the chosen operation, specific prompts will guide the user to input numbers. Additionally, the program will offer an option to continue or exit.

To enhance functionality and organisation, we plan to create distinct functions for each operation:

    Addition: Returns the sum of two numbers.
    Subtraction: Returns the difference between two numbers.
    Multiplication: Returns the product of two numbers.
    Division: Returns the quotient of two numbers.
    Exponentiation: Returns the result of raising one number to the power of another.
    Root: Returns the nth root of a number, where n is specified by the user.
    You will also have access to your previous operations and saving your history
    We have also added some extra feature which will allow users to convert different unit including mass, metre, etc
    We have also thought of our first experience users, that is why have added a Help feature which will help the user to learn about the app.
